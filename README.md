# ProxyDesignPattern
LLD for Proxy Design Pattern

Proxy is a structural design pattern that lets you provide a substitute or placeholder for another object. A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after the request gets through to the original object.

A real world example can be a cheque or credit card is a proxy for what is in our bank account. It can be used in place of cash, and provides a means of accessing that cash when required. And that's exactly what the Proxy pattern does – “Controls and manage access to the object they are protecting“.
